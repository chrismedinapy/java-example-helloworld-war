# Example Hello World WAR-File
This is a fork repo from https://github.com/aeimer/java-example-helloworld-war.git

This contain a WAR file ready for deploy.
It will show you the client IP, and the server IP address.
I'm using this to create an image and then deploy it on a Kubernetes cluster, for testing purposes.
